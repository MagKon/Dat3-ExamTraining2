# Dat3-Startcode
My startcode for the 3rd semester exam

**Step-by-step guide to exam**
* [Step 1](#step-1) - Copy the code into your own repository. 
Make sure your artifact is named correctly. It should just be named dat3
* [Step 2](#step-2) - If the assignment has a database, create it and add the connection info to the POM file
* [Step 3](#step-3) - Make the persistence layer
* [Step 4](#step-4) - Test your persistence layer. Do not use main for this. Use a test class
* [Step 5](#step-5) - Make the REST API. DON'T SCREW YOURSELF BY MAKING AN UPDATE METHOD. IT'S NOT PART OF THE ASSIGNMENT
* [Step 6](#step-6) - Test your REST API. Do not use main for this. Use a test class.

If a step isn't a part of the assignment, you can skip it. Otherwise, use the steps as a guide to what you need to do when.
